TPP:

group2:

id: StrCode32 hash, the group's name. Called in Lua with TppRadio.Play("nameAsString").
FLAGS: unknown 4 bit flags, with an unused 5th bit. Ex: 0, 14.
radioType: radio noise type. "real_time", "optional", "espionage", "map", "mission_image".

phase: phases in which this is allowed to play in.

info:

invalidTimeId: index into a time table of a cooldown timer for the group. 
0 = 0 seconds,
1 = 1 second,
2 = 5 seconds,
3 = 10 seconds,
4 = 15 seconds,
5 = 20 seconds,
6 = 25 seconds,
7 = 30 seconds.
8 and beyond = 0 seconds.

u2: unknown 2 bits. Seemingly unused, but are written variably.

priorityId: index into a priority table. Groups with higher priority won't be interrupted.
0 = 0,
1 = 30,
2 = 40,
3 = 50,
4 = 60,
5 = 70,
6 = 80,
7 = 90,
8 = 98,
9 = 255
1 0 =25,
11 and beyond = 255

playType: enum of a play type that decides how many of the labelParts to play and in what order.
PlayType_StepRandom = 0, //InitPlayIndex if label count!=1 (something) else 0
PlayType_StepRandomNoRepeatLast = 1, //play voices one at a time
PlayType_StepSequenceThenRepeatLast = 2, //during step sequence mode, after playing last step, repeat using last step
PlayType_StepRandomCanRepeatLast = 3, //InitPlayIndex if label count<2 (something)
PlayType_Sequence = 4, //play all parts in sequence at once, most common one
PlayType_StepSequence = 5, //play step, in sequence? used lots in 2 or 1-long groups so hard to confirm
PlayType_6 = 8,//gz 162692253 e0010_rtrg0710
PlayType_7 = 7,
PlayType_StepThenRepeatIds = 8, //play step sequence then random repeatStartId to repeatEndId

startId and endId: index of a labelPart, used when playTime is 8 and possibly other unknown ones.

labelPart:

condition: FNV132 hash. The "condition" state name in the Dynamic Dialogue Event.
dialogueEvent: FNV132 hash. The name of the Dynamic Dialogue Event.
chara: FNV132 hash. The name of the "chara" state name in the Dynamic Dialogue Event.
intervalNextLabelId: index into time table of delay until the next labelPart plays.
0 = 0.400 seconds,
1 = 0.100 seconds,
2 = 0.200 seconds,
3 = 0.300 seconds,
4 = 0.600 seconds,
5 = 0.750 seconds,
6 = 0.900 seconds,
7 = 1.100 seconds,
8 = 1.500 seconds,
9 = 2.000 seconds,
10 = 2.500 seconds,
11 = 3.000 seconds,
12 = 0.500 seconds,
13 = 4.000 seconds,
14 = 5.000 seconds,
15 = 6.000 seconds.

labelGroup: a container of labelParts, played in order.
id: name of the labelGroup. Unknown if StrCode32, but treated here as such.
intervalNextLabelId: ditto.
